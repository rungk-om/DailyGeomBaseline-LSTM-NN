# DailyGeomBaseline-LSTM-NN

This is a repository for the codes for training the neural network to predict a geomagnetic baseline. 

This code is a part of the manuscript "A novel neural network-based approach to derive a geomagnetic baseline for robust characterization of geomagnetic indices at mid-latitude" by Kieokaew et al., submitted to Space Weather, accessible from TBD.
