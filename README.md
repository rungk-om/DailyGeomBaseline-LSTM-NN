# DailyGeomBaseline-LSTM-NN

This is a repository for the codes for training the neural network to predict a geomagnetic baseline. 

This code is a part of the manuscript "A novel neural network-based approach to derive a geomagnetic baseline for robust characterization of geomagnetic indices at mid-latitude" by Kieokaew et al., submitted to Space Weather, accessible from TBD. 

There are two Jupyter Notebooks: 
1. DailyQuietVariation_LSTM_Initial.ipynb <- This is to create an initial model.
2. DailyQuietVariation_LSTM_WalkForward.ipynb <- This is to update the initial model.

Suggestions for setting up the Python environments (conda, tensorflow, keras) can be found in 'instruction.txt'. 

Data can be found under Data/.
